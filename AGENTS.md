# Database types

Derive database types from the Drizzle schema - never hand-write custom or partial
shapes for table rows. Export 'typeof table. $inferSelect' (and '$inferInsert' when
needed) from lib/schema.ts' and import it. When a consumer needs only some
columns, narrow with 'Pick<Row, ... >' / Omit<Row, ... >' rather than redeclaring a
literal type. Don't add an insert type where 'db. insert( ... ).values()' already
enforces the shape.
